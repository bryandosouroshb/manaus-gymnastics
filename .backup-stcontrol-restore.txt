CRITICAL FILE CORRUPTION DETECTED in stcontrol.html

The updateBroadcastOverlay function and all subsequent code is severely corrupted.
Lines 1876-2100+ contain broken syntax with event listeners incorrectly nested inside the function.

The file needs to be restored from a backup or the entire section needs to be rewritten.

Current corruption starts at line 1883 where overlayData object definition is broken.
Event listener code (lines 1884-2100+) should NOT be inside updateBroadcastOverlay function.

Missing functions that should exist:
- loadFXStartListFromDropdown (completely missing)
- updateFullPhaseSelection (completely missing)
- Timer button handlers (misplaced)
- Initialization code (misplaced)
